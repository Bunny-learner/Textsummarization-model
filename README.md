# Textsummarization-model
Implemented a sequence-to-sequence model with LSTM-based encoder and decoder for abstractive text summarization.

Used a subset of the CNN/DailyMail dataset.

Incorporated pretrained GloVe embeddings via an embedding matrix.

Achieved 70% test accuracy; performance improvements in progress.
